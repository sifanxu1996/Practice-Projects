  <h1>Guidelines for Avoiding Plagiarism</h1>

Plagiarism is a kind of fraud.  It is loosely defined as passing off
someone else's work or ideas as your own in order to get a higher mark.  
Plagiarism is treated very seriously.  The assignments you hand in must be
a result of your own work.  They may not contain anyone else's work that is not
explicitly documented as such unless the assignment description specifically
allows this behaviour.
<p>
Note that while documenting the sources of all materials you use to
construct a program will avoid a charge of plagiarism, it may still be
found that your submission is simply a collection of other's work and not a
product of your own effort.  In such circumstances you will receive credit
for the portion of the assignment you have written yourself but not the
portion that was taken from other sources.
<p>
You may discuss assignments with friends and classmates, but only up to a
point.  You may discuss and compare general approaches and also how to
handle a specific difficulty.  However, you should not leave such a
discussion with any written or electronic material.  At no time should
you see (or become aware of by any other means) another
student's solution, in part or in its entirety, on paper or on the
computer screen in completed or draft form.  The actual coding of
programs, analysis of results, writing of reports and solution to written
questions or problems must be done individually.
<p>
It is also a serious offense to help someone commit plagiarism.  Do not lend
your printouts or solutions to others in any manner (including, but not limited
to, on paper, by allowing them to look over your shoulder as you work, by email
etc).  Ensure that the permissions on the directories where you store your work
are set appropriately.  Do not leave printouts on department printers for longer
periods of time than necessary.  Do not discard draft printouts in recycling or
garbage containers within the department.  If you suspect that someone has been
able to acquire a copy of your work inform the instructor for the course
immediately.
<p>
In written assignments you must clearly document the source of any
material that you quote directly regardless of its source.  This includes
the provided course notes and the course textbook.  Within this course it
is not necessary to document the source of material that you use as the
basis of ideas for a written assignment if the words written are your
own and the source material is a commercial publication or the course
notes.
<p>
In programming assignments you must clearly document any block of code 3 simple
statements in length or longer that is taken from another source other than the
course notes or the course textbook.  It is not necessary to document heavily
modified code from another source if the modifications significantly change the
structure, purpose and functionality of the code in question.  Modifications
that meet this constraint are sufficiently extensive that there is no
line-by-line correspondence between the source material and the modified
version whatsoever.
<p>
If you are unsure if your use of outside material in a given context is
acceptable ask the course instructor.  In general, if you are unsure if it
is necessary to include a reference to material you have used it is better
to include the reference than not.
<p>
The preceding policy is an expansion and adaptation of James Stewart's
CISC454 Policy on Plagiarism, Queen's University.
